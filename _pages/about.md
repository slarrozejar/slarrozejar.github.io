Starting in January 2025, I am a postdoc in the [DiverSE][DIVERSE] team in Rennes.
I defended my PhD thesis entitled "Scaling Domain Agnostic Techniques for Program Synthesis" on 10/12/2024, I was supervised by [Nathanaël Fijalkow][NATH] in [LaBRI][LABRI]. You can find my [slides](./files/slides_thesis.pdf) and my [manuscript](./files/thesis.pdf).

You can send me an email at `theomatricon@gmail.com` or `theo.matricon@inria.fr`.

**Feel free to send me a mail just to chat about some interesting work, not necessarily yours!**

## Research Interests

- **Program Synthesis**, *Code Generation*
- Performance Variability
- Machine Learning tools that can help reduce environmental impact

Honestly everything's interesting there's just not enough time but I would like to emphasize that I am more interested in research that stands the test of time (for time = some years not a few months).
