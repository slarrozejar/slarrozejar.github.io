## Research related

- Research for Science should be open-access, see [Plan S](https://www.coalition-s.org/why-plan-s/) and an interesting article in French about [publication models](https://frederichelein.wordpress.com/2019/10/20/le-piege-des-accords-transformants/).
- Do you know [knowledge clustering](https://github.com/remimorvan/Knowledge-Clustering) perhaps it will change the way you write papers?
- [Slow science](http://slow-science.org/)
- If I have a powerful program synthesis algorithm, I'd ask it to generate a program synthesis algorithm and see if it finds itself. Can it find a strictly better algorithm with respect to time but with the same power?
- What if we could thumbs up and thumbs down paper on ArXiv? Would good papers be rewarded or only marketable papers?
- Here is a guide to [CNRS applications](./cnrs)

## Random things about me

My [ha-index](https://www.irif.fr/~haberm/haindex.html) is 80 or 81, I believe it is at least as meaningful as the h-index.

I love climbing, currently I mainly do it inside, feel free to chat with me about it!
I really like <i class="fas fa-globe" style="color:#3498db;"></i> geopolitics, I have a soft spot for romance stories <i class="fas fa-book"></i>. I am also currently watching Case Closed/Detective Conan.
I love playing games <i class="fas fa-dice"></i>, I almost never refuse playing.
I'm currently trying to read bits of philosophy that are related to our society such as feminism for example.

Did you know? I'm French yet I don't drink alcohol, I don't eat cheese nor bread...
I have Crohn's disease and I can't eat gluten nor lactose.
